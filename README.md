This project is about how to use Ultralytics YOLOv8s and YOLOv8n to detect objects in Multiple Video Streams. This project will give you a comprehensive guide how to implement this on your local computer. Follow the steps

## Step 1: Fork the Repo

## Step 2: clone the Repo into your local computer

`git clone https://github.com/Kashif581/Track_Object_in_Mutiple_Video_Using_YOLO.git`

## Step 3: create virtual environment

`python -m venv <virtual_environment_name>`

# Step 4: Install the dependencies

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Step 5: Run the command to start tracking the object
`python <file_name>`


Just follow these steps to start tracking the object in real time
